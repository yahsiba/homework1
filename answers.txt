What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging combines changes from different branches, creating a new commit, while rebase 
integrates changes by moving, combining, or discarding commits, resulting in a linear history.


What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a centralized storage location for a Git project hosted on a server, 
enabling collaboration and version control in distributed development.
